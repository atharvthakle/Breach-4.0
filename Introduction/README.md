This introduction folder will have the guidance on how to start and proceed in the event. And how everything is set up. Firstly, On going to the site, participants will have a welcome message with two options - "Login" and "Register" given below. When the participant will register, an introduction video will be played automatically which can't be paused, resumed or directed forward and backward. The video will be of duration of 2 minutes and 30 seconds (approx.) and many basic intrusctions will be given which were also given before in Rulebook shared on WhatsApp group. So most participants will skip the video as they'll think that they already the info that is being said, but on Level 1's hint 1 they'll realise that the video's end had a clue. So they'll have to rewatch it again.

Below the video, there will be a "Continue" button which will redirect the participant on the sotry page where whole story of the theme (Time Travel) will be given. The story page will be also having a room's image (story context) and the anatagonist's image (who will be shown as protagonist in beggining). After reading the whole story, on scrolling down the participants will have the "Start" option which will redirect them to Level 1.
