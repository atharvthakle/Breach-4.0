Awakening in darkness, my head throbbing and body sore as if I'd been there for an eternity. Confusion clouded my mind; I struggled to recall anything about myself or how I arrived here. The more I strained to remember, the sharper the pain became. Amidst the haze of uncertainty, one thing was clear- I need to find a way out, to escape this unknown that has engulfed me.

My hands fumbled around, searching for any clue about my surroundings. Beneath me was something soft….something like a cushion. As I tried to rise, my feet collided with a solid object, sending a jolt of pain through me. Instinctively, I drew back, the discomfort easing gradually. I realized I was sitting on the edge of the cushion….or was it a bed ? Maybe I had hit the footboard of the bed ?

My hand brushed against a solid, smooth surface. I assured myself, “Ok so there’s a floor”. With cautious steps, I rose from the bed and extended my arms, searching for the walls. Upon making contact with the wall, my questing hand encountered a plastic switch. Instinctively, I flipped it, and the room was suddenly flooded with flickering light of a tubelight which wasn’t visible. It was extremely weird, I can see the light, but not the source. My heart started racing at a pace which was not at all explainable.

When the light stabilized after a few seconds of flickering. Shielding my eyes from the sudden brightness, I gradually adjusted to the illumination. As the room came into focus, I realized it was sparsely furnished- a single bed, a lone door at the other side, and nothing more.
