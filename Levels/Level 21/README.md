• *Question* : Venturing onward through our chosen path, I found myself transported to Italy, standing amidst the vibrant creativity of Leonardo Da Vinci's workshop.

Da Vinci's secrets in hidden rooms.

Cryptic canvases and sketches divine,

Unravel the code, let creativity shine.”

• *Hint*

~ Hint 1 : Reach the hidden depths of Da Vinci's masterpieces within the images provided.

~ Hint 2 : You reach the next level scrutinizing the details of one of Da Vinci's paintings.

• *Answer* : Vituvian

• *EXPLAINATION* : You're given a link for a drive folder. On opening the folder you'll find some images named as Da Vinci's artowrk. But they can't open when you try to "Preview" them, they aren't visible. So you'll have to download the images and try to open the image but same issue, not visible. It's just showing some issue, now the only other default way to open images is - Notepad on windows, and .txt on Mac. So opening this way will get you the answer on one pic as "Vituvian".
