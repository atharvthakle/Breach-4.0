• *Level 14 : (key)₆₄*

• *Question* : “Before we continue, I need you to check this out.” Lonewolf says showing me a file that I should open.
But clicking on the file gets me something I shouldn’t, so I asked, “Lonewolf, you sure this needs to be done to move towards the next stage?”. He replied, “This….This is the next stage, but we should play it fair”

• *EXPLAINATION* : A screenshot of an Unknown Error is provided with an encoded message below "Error code". Now in the question, there's a line that says "we should play it fair", signifying that it's Play Fair cipher. Coming to the level name, the name is (key)₆₄ which means the key of cipher is "base64". On decoding you'll get a riddle as the output which is asking for the place where all this began, that is the event's site, which will be the answer.
