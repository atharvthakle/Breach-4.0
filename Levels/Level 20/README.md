• *Level 20 : Time Is Everything*

• *Question* : And here we are at Area 51. But it felt like we went back in time, which was confirmed when I saw the calendar….2023, WOW. I marveled at the realization of its existence, including the legendary tales of aliens, robots, and time machines that had circulated for years, now proven true before my eyes. "Hey look over there" Lonewolf suddenly drew my attention to a set of clocks displaying times from around the globe, and said “All the clocks are working, but these two….don’t they look weird to you ? And why isn’t the hand moving further ??” after which the clocks disappear. Couldn’t get any worse, Now I gotta find it and solve it.

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Try mirroring or reversing the image.

~ Hint 2 : You’re in the 2013 era.

• *Answer* : Akshay Kumar

• *EXPLAINATION* : There's no image given in this question but some clocks are needed which are frozen, as said in the question. So the only source where you can get the image is IEEE SB's instagram page. When you'll look at the image you'll see some weird time, something that isn't possible. So inverting the image will get you a hidden message, "BOSS IS ??". As the question specifies you're 2013 era, just search on google that who's the boss in 2013. You'll get the Boss movie starring Akshay Kumar as Boss in the results, so Akshay Kumar will be the answer.
