• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Is it similar to Fast & Last Corp. Ltd. ?

~ Hint 2 : The chord given is misplaced, it can be used somewhere where it’s needed.

• *Answer* : Harmony Of Ages

• *EXPLAINATION* : In the image of invitation provided, a QR code is given. Scanning that QR, you'll be redirected to a spotify playlist. Now the answer lies in the first letter of each song. But you'll get the output as "Harmony Of Aes". So now focusing back on the invitation, there's a guitar chord given - G major. So we'll use the G in the output which will become, "Harmony Of Ages", which is the answer.
