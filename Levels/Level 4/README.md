• *Level 4 : Portal Unveiling*

• *Question* : “And here we are, standing at the portal" I exclaimed, a sense of accomplishment washing over me.

“I am a gateway through time's embrace,
In ancient realms and future space.
With coded keys, the portal calls,
To journey where the timeline falls.”

"Lonewolf, a poet as well ?" I quipped upon hearing the eloquent verse. “Hello ? Lonewolf ?! Can you hear me ??”

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Behind the door lies the path to time travel. Portal beckons, and a coded message appears.

~ Hint 2 : Focus on the portal and its surroundings.

• *Answer* : Aeon

• *EXPLANATION* : A morse code is given on the top of the time travel door. Decoding it will get, "Aeon".
