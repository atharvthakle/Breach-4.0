• *Level 24 : Mystic Isle*

• *Question* : I tried to talk to the old man sitting beside the stall. “What are you looking for?”, I asked him. He is in front of me but looks over my shoulder and doesn’t answer. I have been feeling colder and colder since I arrived on this island, and that is not a good sign. I keep turning around as if there is someone following us. On the ground in this abandoned place is a lot of stuff. I seem to see something strange in this old print of the Island.

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Learning Italian might help you find what you are looking for. Be aware, in translator cases make a difference.

~ Hint 2 : Apart from the crew, the boat might be saying something too.

• *Answer* : 68Z4U13

• *EXPLAINATION* : In the image, something it written in Italian. Translating that, you'll get the riddle which will ask you to focus on something small. So if you focus on the big boat on the most left, there's the answer hidden in dim small letter vertically, "68Z4U13".
