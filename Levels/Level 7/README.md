• *Hints* 

~ Hint 1 : Focus on a specific set that conceals a hidden code.

~ Hint 2 : Cipher you are looking for is : ____ (fill in the blank with what catches your eye first)

• *Answer* : Oracle

• *EXPLANATION* : In the image given, there's a cipher code hidden. Now whenever a strange cipher is given (not the common ones like caesar cipher), the cipher that is used is usually hinted in the question prompt or represented in the image provided, usually as background. So in the image, what you notice first is a big pig and some pens, so the cipher is Pigpen cipher. On decoding the message, you'll get "Oracle", which is the answer.
