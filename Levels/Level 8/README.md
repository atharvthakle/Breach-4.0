• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : 404 Error Not Found ? Then find it.

~ Hint 2 : Try reading....reading on YouTube.

• *Answer* : Bermuda Triangle

• *EXPLAINATION* : Below the question, the given link is named as "Start from here". But on using the link you're redirected to a page which says, "404 Error Not Found". But on clicking the same message you'll be redirected to a youtube video as the link of the video was hidden behind "404 Error Not Found". Now on IEEE SB's youtube channel's video, named as "Level 8", you get Rick Rolled. And in description below, the only thing given is "a is o". Now watching the whole video with captions on, on the timestamp of 02:32, you'll see an encoded message. Now that message is encoded in Caesar cipher and by the description given, "a is o", it means that the turn/shift is 14. On decoding you'll get an output as, "an urban legend focused on a loosely defined region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean". Searching this output on google, you'll get the result "Bermuda Triangle", which is the answer.
