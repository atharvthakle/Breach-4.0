• *Level 6 : Timely Demise*

• *Question* : “H- Hell- Hello- Lonewolf this side can you hear me ?” I replied anxiously and asked, “LONEWOLF !! Where did you disappear ?”. Lonewolf replied, “Told you about the glitches and fluctuations, it’s going to keep happening. So don’t rely too much on me, my friend”.
“Yeah you’re right….Wait- What’s that ?! Now I am seeing floating messages and photos ?! Looks like a game as if options are given, or a robot’s view” I said with slight frustration and anger, “Wow, I am in a total mess, don’t know what they’ve done to me. Will deal with General Xeros and his people later.”
Lonewolf inquired, “Which trail did you choose ?”. I replied, “I don’t know which trail goes where, just chose randomly. Hope it turns out good….not fatal”.
Let’s see what this weird floating message got for me.
“Welcome to the early 1800s….” WAIT WHAT- 

Braille's whispers, Louis' age untold…number of truth in dots, behold

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Unlock Louis Braille's secret through tactile whispers, where the answer lies in the echoes of his final years.

~ Hint 2 : Read between the raised dots to unveil Louis Braille's legacy, counting the echoes of his fate to reveal your fate.

• *Answer* : 81

• *EXPLANATION* : In the given doc, you're given a message encoded in Braille. On decoding it, you'll get output like, "tuberclousis43tuberclousis57tuberclousis54tubeclousis43....". Now, Louis Braille's cause of death was tuberclousis at the age of 43. So as the riddle says, "....Louis' age untold…number of truth in dots....", the answer is the number of times 43 is present, which can be found by copying the output, pasting it on word, using "ctrl + F" and searching 43. So it'll provide the number of 43s present.
