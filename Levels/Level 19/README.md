• *Level 19 : Extraterrestrial Teaching*

• *Question* : When I landed in this classroom, I was not able to get out of it. It felt like the moment I stepped out of the door, I got back in from the back door. And that one specific moment of the geography teacher teaching her students was on a loop. So I started my research from the board, some numbers and letters were being taught. But these kids looked old enough for the basic alphabet and numbers. So the chalkboard started having my attention.

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Chalked secrets, locations unknown. Decipher the code, and be gone.

~ Hint 2 : “Lonewolf, What’s the time ?”....“Oh it’s 37 hrs 14 mins and 115 hrs 48 mins 30 secs”

• *Answer* : Area 51

• *EXPLAINATION* : A photo is given with a code. Focusing on some mentions in question like, "Extraterrestrial", "Geography", etc. we get that the code is a Geohash code, which is an alternate way of writting coordinates. So on decoding the geohash code, you'll get the coordinates of Lincoln County, Nevada. On searching more about the location, you'll find that it's famous for Area 51, which is the answer.
