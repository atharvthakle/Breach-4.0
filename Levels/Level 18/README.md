• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Someone from your previous moments will help you in this one.

~ Hint 2 : Unseen numbers reveal a location of what you need to type within the blank canvas.

• *Answer* : Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis

• *EXPLAINATION* : Referring to the question, this level is related to level 15. A document is given which will look blank on opening, but when pressing "Ctrl + A", you'll see that there are some hidden numbers in the form 25:4, 32:1, etc. 
Now going to level 15, Julius Caesar's wikipedia was given, so in its decoded message; i.e., the wikipedia (only the decoded part), the numbers given are locations of characters. Like "28:4" means 28th word's 4th letter. So in sequence all are given, which wiil form the answer - Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.
