Squeeze the key when you know : “What’s common between the death of Osama Bin Laden and the birth of Manipal University - Jaipur ?”

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Find the key, Caesar will set you free.

~ Hint 2 : Digits dance in a numerical maze, add them up to find the craze.

• *Answer* : I Am Being Watched

• *EXPLAINIATION* : On searching the first code, you'll find that it's Hex code. Solving that hex code you'll get a caesar cipher encoded output. But, a key is needed for caesar cipher. So focusing on the line given below, 2011 is common between the death of Osama Bin Laden and the birth of Manipal University - Jaipur. And as it says, "Squeeze the key", we'll add all the digits of 2011 -> 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, which will be the key. Then after solvion the caesar cipher, we'll get the output as "I Am Being Watched", which is the answer.
