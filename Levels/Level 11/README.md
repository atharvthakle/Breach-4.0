• *Level 11 : Drishyam*

• *Question* : "I have a message from Xeros" Lonewolf announced suddenly. Intrigued, I responded, "What is it, Lonewolf?" He continued, "After a few days of his missing, we finally found our commander today….but dead. We're unable to determine the cause of death as a cause of death always has a name, not the one you see, but the one a doctor always describe in medical terms" Faced with this perplexing news and unsure of what action to take since I can’t find the murderer, I hesitated before asking, "Ok….and….? Hello ??"

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Focus….Focus is all it takes, Focus on whatever catches your eye and just search it down.

~ Hint 2 : What you get can be the answer, but not exactly. It can have other names too.

• *Answer* : Cerebral Death

• *EXPLAINATION* : A photo is given which has a TV in background and is blurred and focused on coffee in front of it. When you search "blur coffee tv", you'll get "Coffee & TV - song by Blur". Now you're given "11 : 3 4" in question. So going to the song's lyrics at 3rd and 4th word of 11th line, you'll get "brain dead", which you'll search and find that it's also known as "Cerebral Death" ( why search different name ? context : question), which is the answer.
