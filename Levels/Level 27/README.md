• *Level 27 : Cool Ways To Die*

• *Question* : From the Moon to Earth, this journey is truly warping my perception now. Yet here I stand, amidst another battleground. “Can it get any more surreal ?” I ponder silently. But this conflict is peculiar.

Lonewolf chimes in, “We've entered a future war, my friend.” I respond, “It's eerily melodic, isn't it ? No gunfire, no explosions. Just a sense of destruction lingering around and this sound of some music”

• *Answer* : 101 Cool Ways To Die

• *EXPLAINATION* : In the video provided, it has just an image of futuristic tanks with a background music. But on shazaming the video, No results are found and it's not audible as well, the lyrical part is just gibberish. So you'll have to donwload the video and reverse its audio in order to listen to the audio properply. Doing this and shazamingm you'll get the audio as 505 by Arctic Monkeys. Focusing in the image, there's "/5" below 1 tank. So 505 will be divided by 5 and the result will be 101. Looking at the level name, answer will be "101 Cool Ways To Die".
