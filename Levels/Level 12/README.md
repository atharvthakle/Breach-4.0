*Level 12 : Pirate's Plunder*

• *Question* : Upon finding the commander's apparently natural cause of death, which could potentially be a murder, I arrived at the deserted island where Blackbeard's treasure was rumored to be hidden. But that’s not what I seek. Amidst the wreckage, I stumbled upon some maps scattered around….but none of them was any country’s flag.

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Navigate the high seas of secrecy with flags unfurled, where each signal leads to the next destination from the hidden world.

~ Hint 2 : Raise the flags high and decipher their message to move to your next stage.

• *Answer* : Time Is Running

• *EXPLAINATION* : A series of flags is given but as said in question, they aren't country maps. So on searching you'll find that it's Maritime Flag Cipher, decoding which you'll get the answer, "Time Is Running".
