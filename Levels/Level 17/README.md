• *Level 17 : Subway Secrets*

• *Question* : I’m here on this abandoned subway's route. With this old man whose name neither I nor Lonewolf know. He just spawned outta nowhere, and he has never said anything intelligible to me. Just gestures, verses, screams. Now he is standing in front of me, impassive, covering his eyes with one hand. He covers them, uncovers them, covers them, uncovers them and has a grotesque smile on his face. I can’t move, the whole thing is absurd. I wonder if I will make it home alive. Then the old man suddenly yells, “WHO NEEDS TO KNOW ??”

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Do you really know who needs to know ??

~ Hint 2 : Try matching old man’s words with the ones on wall.

• *Answer* : No One Needs To Know

• *EXPLAINATION* : An encoded message is given on the ceiling of subway whose image is provided, along with keys to some characters. Focusing on "Who needs to know" that is given in question, on putting the characters in place by the ones given, you'll notice almost all are similar to "who needs to know". So solving the same, will get you the answer, "No One Needs To Know".
