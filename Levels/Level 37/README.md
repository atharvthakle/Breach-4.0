• *Level 37 : Turing Chess*

• *Question* : As I reached Dublin, a chessboard was presented to me, its pieces poised in silent challenge. Lonewolf's sudden return from the shadows brought unsettling news, "Apologies for my absence," Lonewolf's voice crackled with a hint of distress, "I've been infected by a malicious program." Shocked, I demanded answers, but Lonewolf's calm demeanor soothed my worries. Lonewolf continued, "Regardless of what happens, I'll cherish our bond and the journey we've shared."

With emotions running high, I refocused on the task at hand, determined to unravel the mysteries that lay ahead.

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Dive into the world of chess and computing to uncover the connection.

~ Hint 2 : Alan Turing might help you with this one.

• *Answer* : Turochamp

• *EXPLAINATION* : When you open the drive link provided, you'll see a chess board's image and a background music with it. Shazaming the background music, you'll realise that it's the background music of the movie "The Imitation Game", which is about Alan Turing and what's related about Turing with chess is he developed a chess program "Turochamp", which is the answer.
