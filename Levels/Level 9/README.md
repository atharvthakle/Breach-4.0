• *Level 9 : Bard's Secrets*

• *Question* : Venturing through the enigmatic twists of the Bermuda Triangle's temporal loophole, I stumbled into the heart of Shakespeare's era, finding myself within the bustling walls of his workplace. As I explored the surroundings, one book particularly caught my attention as it was being highlighted in my view, and its significance heightened by Lonewolf's intriguing words :

“Within Shakespeare's tome of lore,
Hidden messages, a cryptic score.
Unravel with writer’s light,
Move to the next stage, reveal the plight.”

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Try reading Shakespear’s work….CAREFULLY.

~ Hint 2 : Consider the thematic relevance of the binary you find within the writings.

• *Answer* : Chrono

• *EXPLANATION* : In the image provided, you'll see that it's Shakespear's work. Now reading his work carefully, you'll notice that in each paragrph, "i" is written as 1 and "o" is written as 0.
So each paragraph will have a binary number of 8 digits and each number represents a letter which you can find by decoding. Now the last paragraph of left page and first paragraph of right page are not different paragraphs. They are given like that to confuse the participant, they are actually connected. So decoding each paragraph you'll get the word "Chrono", which is the answer.
