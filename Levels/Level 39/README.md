• *Level 39 : Train To Catch*

• *Question* : I bought the ticket and got on the train. But little did I know, the ticket was not as it should be based upon the time period we’re in. And guess what- The ticket was in the name of someone I never expected.

Lonewolf’s voice broke through tension, “I am scanning the train and only 1 person matches the DNA with Dr. Tempus’s” Then he suddenly points, “THERE ! There he is”, highlighting the man dressed in 1980s attire.

After apprehending him, Dr. Tempus attempted to doubt, “I know who you are, but you don’t know what you’re doing” I replied, “I don’t care about your stories you’re coming with me I just wanna get back to my normal life”

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : The cipher is….what’s catching your eye, again.

~ Hint 2 : Number of trains present might be an answer you need in this one.

• *Answer* : Running Out Of Time

• *EXPLAINATION* : There's an encoded message in the ticket provided. So as said before, the cipher will be from background in this one, that is the rail fence cipher. To decode this, you'll also need a key (numeric), and the number of trains are 2, so 2 will be the key and decoding the encoded message will get you "Running Out Of Time", which is the answer.
