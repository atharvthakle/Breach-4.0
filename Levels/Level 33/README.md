• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : How can anyone even send a text rotated vertically ? What does it mean ??

~ Hint 2 : Try reversing, but differently.

• *Answer* : Tetepare Island

• *EXPLAINATION* : In the message, two texts are given - one is horizontal and one is vertical, signifying longitutes and latitudes. So decoding them simply by corresponding the numbers with their letters and letters with their numbers, we get coordinates of an island - Tetepare Island.
