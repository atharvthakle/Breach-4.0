• *Level 10 : Battista B's Legacy*

• *Question* : Considering that my next stop would likely be nearby, given my current location in Europe, I was astounded to find myself propelled into the future but which year was it ? The scene was a bustling celebration, filled with people immersed in the marvels of advanced technology, surrounded by computers and screens aplenty. "You seeing this Lonewolf?" I inquired eagerly. He replied : 

“ebx's srilb egmlxoea xrafvnp ac guyftno”

“Not even surprised now” I said to myself when suddenly another message popped up in front of me :

BCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWYZ

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : G. Battista B will guide you.

~ Hint 2 : Some letters are missing….or should I say keys are missing ?

• *Answer* : 2031

• *EXPLAINATION* : A cipher is given in the question and further, a list of all english alphabets is given but it has A, J and X missing. Now focusing on the level name, when you'll search Battista B cipher, you'll get that Giovan Battista Bellaso invented Vigenere cipher. So the cipher is Vigenere. Now it's keys, ajx is the key for solving this one.
When you decode, you'll get output as, "ESA's juice explorer arrives on Jupiter", searching which, you'll get that its future mission of ESA and will happen in 2031, which is the answer.
