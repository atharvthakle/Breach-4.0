~ Link Name (important in this level) : Page 342

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : The wall, shelf and volume is already given.

~ Hint 2 : Sometimes what’s in front of us is also invisible.

• *Answer* : Metadata

• *EXPLAINATION* : As mentioned in the question, we'll go to the Library Of Babel. In babel's library, we'll browse. Following each step, the document given provides you with the hex code that is needed in browsing in babel's library. Now in the question, we're given 3, 4 and 30 hidden. So it's in the same order of whatever is asked, first hex code, then wall, shelf and then volume. But in this level, link name is also important as when we'll browse putting all the credentials, on arriving at the page we've to search Page 342, which is the link name. Doing so, we'll get the answer, metadata.
