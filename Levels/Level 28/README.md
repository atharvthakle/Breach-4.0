• *Question* : “Quick, keep moving ! We don't wanna be collateral damage !” Lonewolf's urgent voice echoed as we sprinted towards the portal, leaving the war behind.
After I took the leap of life through the portal for the next stage, I found myself in a calm and peaceful setting.

Lonewolf's voice broke the silence, “One of the biggest Bhagavad Gita you'll ever see is there in Iskcon Temple, Delhi. Hidden in there, the answer to this question lies bare. Its area that it covers hides a location in it. Oh ! You haven't taken a peek yet ? Find the speaker and he’ll send you further”

• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Seek the voice within chapter 1, for therein lies the guide.

~ Hint 2 : Verse's speaker holds the key to your quest.

• *Answer* : Arjuna

• *EXPLAINATION* : In the question, bhagvad gita is referred. A specific bhagvad gita. Now searching about it, what makes it so specific and special will be used further, that is its dimension - 2.8 M. So in bhagvad gita, speaker of chapter 1's 28th verse is the answer.
