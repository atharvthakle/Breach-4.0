• *Hints*

~ Hint 1 : Numbers for calling aren’t supposed to be just 10 digits ? Then what could it be ??

~ Hint 2 : A writer will always know this number.

• *Answer* : Replay

• *EXPLAINATION* : When you look at the number provided in the image of pager, you realise that it's not a 10 digit number. So of course it's something else, when you search upon this kind of numnber you find that it is ISBN number. So searching this number gets you the book, "Replay" which is the answer.
