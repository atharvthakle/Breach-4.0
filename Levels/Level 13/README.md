“Let’s just write down whatever we can, it can have something for us” Lonewolf suggested. Agreeing with him I started writing whatever I could see but it looked a little weird as it was difficult to identify what kind of business was this ad about but only one thing was clear that the company was called First & Last Corp. Ltd. and it said they are one of the top 10 in the world.
