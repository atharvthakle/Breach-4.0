• *Level 40 : Quarantined*

• *Question* : In the midst of a tense exchange with Dr. Tempus and delving into the revelations from the files he shared, the realization struck me like a thunderbolt; General Xeros was the true villain orchestrating this chaos. His calculated omissions and deceptions were now laid bare before me, painting a grim picture of the stakes involved.

Overwhelmed by guilt and responsibility, I berated myself internally, “UGH- What have I been doing ? Now the whole world is at stake because of me” However, Tempus explained a sliver of hope and a plan forward. Assuring me that there was still time to thwart Xeros' plans, he entrusted me with the crucial task of entering the password into the anti-paradox detonator to disrupt Xeros' schemes.

I steeled myself for the challenges ahead as Lonewolf's presence faded with his final words, “I have scanned it, it’ll be ok. Don’t worry friend, go on, save the world. Everything will be fine.”

~ Hint 1 : You’re in the 2020-21 era.

~ Hint 2 : Remove the virus.

• *Answer* : 4321

• *EXPLAINATION* : Opening the link provided, you'll get "This site cannot be reached", which is intentional. The anonymous message asks to remove unnecessary things from life, so focusing on the level name, it's related to corona. When you look at the link carefully, you'll realise it has covid19, removing that, the link will become, "https://level-40-breach-6gfbd98tn3d1xa.netlify.app/". So you'll be taken to another page where an equation (√16 + 3 × 2 − 1) is given with a riddle below, "It is in the roots, not the branches, that a tree's greatest strength lies". So as the riddle says, only the root will work, others won't. Then, the answer will be 4321.
