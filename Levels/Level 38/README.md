• *Level 38 : Tooot Tooot*

• *Question* : Upon reaching this futuristic station, where bullet trains whizzed by like streaks of light, a stranger handed me a template. At first, I dismissed it as a mundane offering, perhaps from a salesman plying his wares. However, upon closer inspection, the template revealed hidden intricacies. I needed to catch a train and for that I needed to find my next destination.
Lonewolf's voice broke the silence, "In this era of mega projects and advanced technology we shall explore our surroundings, or maybe the template can help us too."
