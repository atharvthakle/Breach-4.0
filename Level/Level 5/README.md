• Level 5 : Choosing The Right Trail

• Question : “Wow, so now I have different trails in the portal and I'm pretty sure I have to choose one by answering something again”, I muttered to myself. And then….

One man's ____ is another man's ____

“Oh not again, why am I faced with all these riddles, quotes, etc. Wait ! General Xeros also said something like this. And seriously, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU LONEWOLF ?!”

• Hints

~ Hint 1 : It is a famous title, and has been made into a movie.

~ Hint 2 : Try asking Dan Brown.

• Answer : Angel and Demon

• EXPLANATION : In the story that was given after the introduction video. There was a line where General Xeros said, "....Don’t trust anyone, demons you come across can be someone else’s angel, or….vice versa". So the question is based on this particular line, and as mentioned in the line, "vice verse", the answer will be Angel and Demon. And it won't be Angels and Demons as in the question it clearly says, One man's ____ "is" another man's ____ .
